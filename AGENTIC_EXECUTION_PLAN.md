# Agentic Execution Capability for Marimo - Phased Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a phased approach to add agentic execution capabilities to Marimo, transforming it from a reactive notebook into an AI-powered autonomous development environment. The plan leverages Marimo's existing reactive architecture and adds intelligent agents that can write, execute, and iterate on code autonomously.

## Core Vision

Enable Marimo notebooks to act as autonomous agents that can:
- Accept high-level goals and break them into executable tasks
- Generate and execute code cells autonomously
- Monitor execution results and self-correct
- Collaborate with users through interactive feedback loops
- Learn from execution patterns and improve over time

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

### 1.1 Agent Core Infrastructure
**Goal**: Build the foundational agent system that can interface with Marimo's runtime

**Implementation**:
- Create `marimo/_agent/` module structure:
  ```
  marimo/_agent/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── core.py          # Base agent class
    ├── executor.py      # Code execution interface
    ├── planner.py       # Task planning logic
    ├── memory.py        # Agent memory/context
    └── prompts.py       # LLM prompt templates
  ```
